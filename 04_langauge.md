### What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
Creative coding with Scratch-6th grade. Student experience ranges from no experience to various levels of experience in elementary grades.

### What is the language?
Scratch

### How does one write & run code in this language?
It is a block-based language /drag-and-drop platform with a run button.

### Rate the complexity of the syntax
Simple syntax while  allowing the use of advanced CS concepts

### Strengths
Teaches advanced programming concepts without getting bogged down in complex syntax. Also, it is excellnet for debugging since students can click on any block of codes to see how it is working, rather than clicking the run button and exceute the whole program at once.  

### How would you utilize the strengths in the class?
Since it is a drag-and-drop platform, it is easy to change the code by quickly rearranging the blocks and asking “what if” questions to encourage student exploration/self-discovery. Also, students can explore and learn from trial and error.

### Weaknesses
Students will have difficulty moving to text language. Each sprite needs to be coded seperately: students need to click on each sprite to see the code and the costumes. It would be nice if all lines of code were on the same page, similar to Snap programming.  

### How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
Provide students with ample oppoprtunities for Practice code analysis and debugging. This will help them conceptualize the principles of computing and ease the path to text language.
