# I use with my middel school students a modified version of the CSD/code.org

# Similarities
I implement unit 3 of the Computer Science Discoveries /Game Design that focuses on the fundamental concepts of programming. 

# Differences
Code.org's curriculum  recommends that students start with Unit One that focuses on problem solving and the iteretive design process using various unplug activities. Code.org suggests that teacher spends about 3-4 weeks on this non coding unit. However, I found students loose the motivation when they do repetitive unplugged activities. Therefore, i do not spend much time on unit one. Rather we dive into the problem solving process while students working on the Game Design unit. Additionally, code.org lessons are over scaffolding which might prevent students from  getting the big idea. Therefore, I skip some of those lessons and teach the concept directly while providing ample opportunities to practice. 

# Weaknesses
I think CSD should should be only a text- based language rather than a block/text- based option. 

# Strengths
The CSD has strong assessment tools: Exemplar projects, sample marked rubrics, teacher dashboard, and teacher feedback.(the updated 2022 version)

# Adaptations
My future plan is to use  some of  the CSP 's lessons that teach students about  the representation of digital information and the design of the internet. It is critical that students understand the binary system and how does the internet process information. And most importantly, the social impact of digitizing the worldâ€™s information.
